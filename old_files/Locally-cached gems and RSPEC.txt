Local gems (especially RSPEC) install process:
1. install bundler by running `gem install bundler`
2. follow the steps on https://bundler.io/v1.2/bundle_install.html
    to create local directories vendor/bundle and vendor/cache and save files there
3. install the RSPEC gem locally to your app by putting it in your local Gemfile:
        `source "https://rubygems.org"`
        `gem 'rspec'`
4. http://rspec.info/ demonstrates how to go from zero to red quickly. Follow that.
